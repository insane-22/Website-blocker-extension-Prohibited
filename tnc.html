            <p>Greetings Users!</p>
            <p>We are really happy to see you here. We present the latest project of Slay HIB Team. This one is a
                productivity Web Extension. We hope you would like it a lot. The agenda is quite clear as always to
                present the best product to our respected users.</p>
            <p>The first one is our Web-Blocker whise main function is to block a certain websites. As of now, it blocks
                youtube, facebook, netflix pages i.e. not just the homepage but all the connected pages. Enabling this
                extension would block all these subsites and you can disable it anytime.</p>
            <p>The other part is On-Click extension. This one helps you to block website after passage of certain amount
                of time.</p>

                sources and thus helping them to maintain discipline while doing their work.</p>
